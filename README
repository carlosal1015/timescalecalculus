# Limitations
# -----
# at this point, a timescale can be any list, and so since it is represented by computer, it is a finite time scale (necessarily discrete)
# we are also restricted to the 1-dimensional case -- something that needs to be remedied!!!
# no complex time scale functionality yet
#
# -----
# To further generalize
# -----
# simple logic should be able to add the capability of finite unions of finite intervals and also infinite intervals
# after that, limit points like the one forced by taking the closure of {1,1/2,1/3,1/4,1/5,...} (i.e. "Cantor-Bendixson rank 1"), not sure how hard that will be
# and hopefully higher CB-rank -- if we solve some like the above, then these should be easy?
